SYNOPSIS
========

This project contains **run\_analysis.R**, an R script that modifies data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from raw form into a tidy data format.

To use run\_analysis, first download source data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Next, unzip the file in your working directory.  You should have a new directory called "UCI HAR Dataset" in your working directory, with data and subdirectories in it.

Execute run\_analysis.R in an R console or RStudio.

The script will produce two output files in your working directory, **tidyDF.csv** and **summaryDF.csv**

See the file **CodeBook.md** for a detailed description of the input data files, the output data files, and the processing methodology.


MOTIVATION
==========
The project was conducted to satisfy the requirements for the Coursera **Getting and Cleaning Data* Course Project.
